//  6.  Your Reflection:
//During this pairing session, I did not havae a partner. Partner got mixed up with time 
//and ended up joining at the end.
//My gudie was very patient with me. I had a little trob=uble understanding the concept of
//javascript. He suggested I rdo the CodeCademy track of Javascript which will help me. 
//I plan to take his advice and do the track tomorrow.
