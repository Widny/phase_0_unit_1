My Website url: https://widny.github.io/index.html
Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
-I learned that design is baout solving problems. You want to be able to create a website that users will find attarctive. Things you need to think about hwne designing a website is the flow of the website, spacing. and what problem is your website solving. I feel that use exeprice is more than design. User experince id how a customer interact with the website, the speed., are there tooo many steps to purchase. Is the website designed in a way where customers are converting. 


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

It was great working on the website because i gave me a chance to apply most of what I've learned in the past tow weeks. The website still needs a lot of improvement. Although, it was great buiding a website. it took up the bulk of my time. I am  perfectionist. i cane up with 50 different wieframes. When I finally stared working on the website, it changed multiple times agaian. therefore the website looks nothing like the wireframe. I am still not happy with the website, but it is a start.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
 For me, the wireframing did not work for me. I am still not satisfied with the design of the website as well bu it is a work in proress.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to add nore content and more styling. i'd like to have my blogs embedded in the blog section of the website so it does not take to a different webpage..I would also like my on video the the homepage. etc...

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool? It was not that difficult. i got stuck on section  of the website for the whhole day. It turned out to be a spelling error. When I relaized it the next, i couldn't stop kicking myself internaly.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
