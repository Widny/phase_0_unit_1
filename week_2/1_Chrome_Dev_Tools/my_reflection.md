# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

Document Object Model is a programming interface for HTML  and XML documents. 

The DOM provides a representation of the documents as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. 

A web page is  document which can be displayed either in the browser window , or as HTML  source. The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page. Most browsers will probable arrange your html in a DOM in which you can access on dev tools. The DOM allow developers to manipulate web pages. The DOM defines the relationship between different elements in the documents.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

This makes a lot of sense to me. It is particularly easy to find specific elements in dev tools.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I find dev tools very  very helpful I use it as a tool for seeing real time changes as I play around with code.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?


dev tools is a really good resource to see the different styling of the elements. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
