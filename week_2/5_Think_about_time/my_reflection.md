# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
- Please see below for my reflection. Again, I am long winded and all over the place. 

My biggest challenge is myself. I put in more than the required amount of tone for the assignments now that I am able to focus on DBS assignment full time. For the past week, I have been at the library be approximately 9am or 10 am and stay for about 5 to 6 hours with some breaks in the middle. 

When I get into an assignment, I have a tendency to feel that i have to master the subject. when i don't I get frustrated. After that i go on a downward spiral of panic, shame. This causes me to get stuck on a problem. instead of moving on to something else. i spend the rest of the day trying to get unstuck. By the time, i figure it out, I am very frustrated with myself. 

The next problem i have is that everything I have to be perfect. For example, our solo challenge was to work on out github index webpage. I must have drawn about 50 different websites. When I finally started working on the website.It changed again about ten times. The final product looks nowhere near my wireframe image. this was very time consuming.

Another thing is that i love to read non fiction but especially non fiction. When I finished college and started working full time, i was deprived. now that I am free I get to read again. i read in the evening after i have returned form the library. I  get so engrossed in the novel that I can lose track of time. Therefore, i sleep 2 or 3am. This is not good because, i have to have enough sleep in order for me to be productive. If not, I'm really slow for the whole day.


* How will you combat that? 

If I get stuck and i see I am not able to resolve the problem in an hour, then it is time for me to move on and work on something else. Perhaps if i go back to it the next day, I may be able to resolve the problem

Try to remain positive. Whenever I get stuck, I get upset at myself and I become very critical of my intelligence which is not good. I will try to be more aware of that feeling and try to think positively. 

* What techniques will you try?
For me, it is not an issue of time management. For me it is more of a mental behavior. 

If i get stuck in a certain area, i can reach out to my cohort for help. i do not need to feel embarassed and shy. I am an introvert. 

I tend to do the work but do not complete the assignments. i leave assignments uncompleted because i feel i need to come back to it to work on it some more. This goes back to needing to feel that I  need to every nuance of every concept. Perhaps,  

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
successfully complete all the assignments. 
Be on time in submitting my work  going forward
Reaching out to my cohort so that I can get help and be available to help others. 
Be competent in the assignments that I am given.
