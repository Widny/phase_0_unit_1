# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is being able to have the design of your website well designed in every screen. What looks good on a normal pc screen or laptop may not look as nice in smaller screen real estate.  I like it and think it is good practice. it is very important that all of the content is viewable on all screen sizes as society become more mobile.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

I believe it has changed web design tremendously because it has made programmers think of ways to make beautiful web design on any screen size. 

I feel think that new technology will force web design to be more creative. I believe we will get to a point where you will no longer need to have a small device to access the web. I believe in the future everything will be very connected. I believe that the internet is going to be more dimensional. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
I absolutely believe that we should defintiely  create a website for visually impaired people. They should be able go about their daily  lives as everyone else, while having qa good user  esperience. The way to design a website for a visually impaired is by using a screen reader. the website should be very simple. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

User experience on all technology. desingning so that the user have a wonderful experience.
