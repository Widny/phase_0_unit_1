Blog url: file:///Applications/widny.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


I really enjoyed working on the technical blog. This project helped me be more aware of way makes a website more engaging and what to focus on. I do feel that this was helpful on my learning. HTML and css is a front end development told, therefore it was very appropriate we learned about user experience right now. Also, it appears that the most successful website are the ones that are provides a wonderful user experience and engagement. I did not find the blog to be cumbersome. 

I felt certain about the website I chose to talk about.  I feel less certain about my design aesthetics.  I can visualize how i would like my websites to look like but i have trouble executing the idea.
