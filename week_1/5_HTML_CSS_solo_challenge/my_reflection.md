1. While working on this solo project. I had so many questions like how to make a horizontal navigation list or how to float and position. I also had questions how to hover and how to link to section on the same pages. The internet was a great resource to help answer my questions.


2. I most had trouble with css. I understand HTML. Specifically on positioning. I have to keep playing around. I am still trying to figure it out. I also have trouble with designing a website. I am still trying to figure out css positioning.

3. I learned how to make a horizontal list. Also one trick I do is that I put a solid border around each element. It helps me a little while playing around with css.

4. I understand the concept of design and user interface, the importance of wireframing. I am also confident with HTML. Still working in css.
