## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person


To create a respoistory on github. you must first create oor login to your account.

    1. The first step is to click on "Create new repository"
    2. Give it an interesting name
    3. set it to public so that other people may view and contribute to your projet. You can set it to private if you don't
       want publc involved
    4. choose the license type which grants permission on how contributors can use the code.
    5. click on create repository
    6. click on settings in the "feature section" and check next to issue. This will allow others to give you feedback on
       your site. 


* Describe what open source means

Open source is sharing how a computer program or application was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit. Most open source project are create by non-for profit organizations who rely on the community to create a meaningful product or project. 

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?


I think open source is acceptable for some projects. For example,  a non for profit organization or person trying to build a program that benefits the community and itâ€™s infrastructure. The organization can host events where developers come together to create an amazing application.
       
 What makes me really nervous about using open source is the the quality of some of the features or the program itself due to engineers of different skill level contributing to the project. The program or application can be subject to  a lot of bugs or viruses.  Additionally, people can have the license to use your coding to do something your coding was not what is was intended for. 
       
* Assess the importance of using licenses


It's important to use a licenses because they grant permission on how peole can use your code. Some licenses are more restrictive or than others. It is important that the creator knows the differences of each licenses 
A GNU General Public is the most commonly used license for open source projects. it allows users to legally copy , distribute, and modify software.

MIT license is the shortest and the broadest of all popular open source licenses. The license basically states that the userpermission to obtain the software. There is no limitation on the right to use, copy , modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies if the software.

Creative Commons license is not quite as open-source as other licenses. You can freely share the work , bu not change it or charge for it. this is a good way to get yor coding out there but keep control over it. 

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The reading material regarding open source was very helpful and provided sufficient information to help me understand what open source is and the different licenses out there. I did not struggle with this concept at all. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did not use any other resources.
