## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

I learned the difference between the internet and the web. I have always thought the web and the internet was the same thing. 


The internet is basically a network of interconnected computers that uses protocols (IP address) to talk to one another. The internet network makes all of our communication and data sharing possible. the world wide web is basically an application that is built on top of the internet to share and access information online. 


The second thing I learned is the difference between a web app and a website. A website is static. it can be beautifully designed using only HTML and CSS. There is no programming involved.  All you do is read information. This is ideal for a blog or a marketing website. However,  a web application is interactive and engaging. The user can input information and  expect the application to provide output. A web application still has to be created with html or css but you add programming language on top of it like pyhton , Ruby in rails, PHP, etc.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

Important things to remember when setting up an HTML site is that you can put anything on there if you associate with the appropriate tag. It is mark language that shows your content. In order to have it styled you must link it to a style sheet.

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

This was not the first time i made a web page go live but I felt the same as the first time. This is my canvass to share with the world what i have to offer. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

i did have an aha moment when reading the materials you provided regarding the difference between the internet and the world wide web. I used to think they were both the same. Most of the material i read solidified what i had already learned regarding web servers, DNS, and IP addresses.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


I did not use any other material for this assignment as I felt the materials provided sufficient information and clarification.
