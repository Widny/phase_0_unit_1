## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I followed the instruction on setting up git on the computer, however I have trouble locating git on my computer my mac. I did not have any struggles  setting up GitHub. The instructions were  easy to follow. 

* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Git is a version control system that you can download to your local computer. Git will allow you to track changes you made to your file or revert back to earlier versions. On git you write commands like “ git init”, “git add”, or "git commit” .Github is a social website on the web where you can publish your repository to the public.It is stored in the cloud rather than your personal computerAnyone can contribute and you will be able to track when changes were made and who made the changes. You can also access your github repository from anywhere around the world and on different computers. 

* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.


*Version control keeps track of your changes. you are able to revert changes. you can also collaborate with other coders and programmers. it prevents coders from overriding each other codes. GitHub is a social site where you can make your repository available to the public. Anyone can fork the repository and make contribute to the project. Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Version control make sense to me. Git make sense to me, however using it is a little foreign.I know with practice I will become more familiar with it. Github makes sense to me.
