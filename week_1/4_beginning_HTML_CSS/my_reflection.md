* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


I understand that HTML  is markup language that shows your structured content. Some of the tags needed in order to create your content make sense to me. What does not make sense to me the complexity of it all. it understand that we have to create divs and close tags. i do not understand why it is so complex.


the good thing about HTML is that you can create your content and immediately see your content live on the web. The bad thing about HTML is the complexity of it all. having to remember to close tags or create ids or classes. 

 did have an aha moment when embedding the youtube video on  my website. Thanks to Andrew during office hours. the importance of making your closing your tags or quotations are very important. 
 
 I used w3school.com to help with positioning and centering. I also used cssbasics.com and stack overflow to help with padding and margins.
